# TheCrewRp Launcher

TheCrewRp Launcher was built from the ground up to make it easier to connect to the roleplay server.

We can now celebrate featured content creators within TheCrewRp Launcher enabling you to meet some of your new favorite content creators!

TheCrewRp launcher also features community news and announcements related to the community and servers.

Quickly at a glance you can see the population of the server and the queue. Simply click the area to refresh it!

When you're ready to roleplay simply click play and the launcher will automatically connect you to TeamSpeak and the game server. Once successfully connected TheCrewRp Launcher will close automatically for you.

Along the bottom you'll find links to important areas of the community including the website, rules, MDT, TheCrewRpedia and Patreon.
